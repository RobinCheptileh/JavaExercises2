# JAVA EXERCISES

This is a set of four simple Java exercises. The project was created using Intellij IDEA and is organized in such a manner that it has a main file (Main.java) where it lists all questions and allows you to choose which you'd like to view the solution.
The questions are as follows:
1. Write a program that translates a text to pig-latin and back.
2. Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome.
3. Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome (Method 2).
4. Write a program that determines whether two positive integer numbers are co-prime. Two numbers are co-prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) = 1.
5. Write a program that finds the Kth element in a list.
